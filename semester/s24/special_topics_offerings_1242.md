## CS Undergraduate Special Topics

### CS 4501: Intro to Algorithmic Economics w/ Profs. Nekipelov (ECON) and Wei (CS)
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits  / Prerequisites: C- or better in CS 2150 or CS 3100)_  

- A student who is double-majoring will only be allowed to count Algorithmic Economics (either the CS 4501 or the ECON 4740 section) for one of their majors, not both.
- The current SIS rules are this:  CS4501 will count as CS elective in any CS major. ECON 4740 can count as an Integration Elective for BACS majors, and as an "HSS" elective for BSCS majors.
- If after taking the course, the student decides the section they took is NOT the one they really needed to in order to meet the requirement, then the two departments will be willing to enter a SIS exception to make this work.  (E.g., CS will enter a SIS exception to allow CS4501 to count as an Integration Elective for a BSCS major.)  But we will be firm about only allowing it to count for a requirement in one degree and not both.
- Students should do their best to sign up for the ECON or CS section based on how they want it to count.  Entering SIS exceptions requires time and energy, and we'd like to avoid that as much as possible.  If the section you want is full, see if the instructor can permission-grant you into the full section before signing up for the section you know will not normally count the way you want it to.

### CS 6501: Responsible AI Seminar: Privacy, Fairness, and Robustness w/ Prof. Fioretto
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits  / Prerequisites: TBD)_  

This course explores the intersection of differential privacy, fairness, and robustness in the context of machine learning and decision tasks. Students will delve into the theoretical foundations, practical applications, and ethical implications of these concepts, with a focus on developing responsible AI systems. Part of this seminar will be focused on studying responsible generative AI. 

**Course Objectives**:
1. Understand the principles of differential privacy, fairness, and robustness in machine learning.
2. Analyze the trade-offs and synergies between privacy, fairness, and robustness.
3. Develop skills to implement basic differentially private, fair, and robust machine learning algorithms.
4. Critically evaluate the ethical implications of AI and machine learning technologies.
5. Conduct original research in the field of responsible AI.

**Expected Background**: Students are expected to have some prior basic background in machine learing and optimization. Students are also expected to learn whatever background they need on the class topics on their own. The seminar is open for PhD students and research-focused graduate students with interests in machine learning, privacy, fairness, and related topics.

**Course Content**: In this seminar, we'll cover materials ranging from seminal papers, recent research articles, to more casual blogs. While our focus is primarily on the technical facets of privacy, fairness, and robustness, we will also touch their ramification in societal repercussions.

## Special Topics Outside CS

### ENGR 4880: Business and Technical Leadership in Engineering w/ Prof. Jean Tom
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits)_
This course is focused on topics which will prepare fourth year engineering students for a successful transition to the technical workplace and will help students answer the following questions: What do they need to know to help them translate their technical knowledge in the workplace to be an impactful contributor? How will they develop their career?  

The course is divided into 4 modules. During the Module 1 Understanding Yourself & Working with Others, you will learn about your communication style and those of others and strategies to communicate, network and collaborate with others effectively. In module 2, Understanding the Workplace, we will cover aspects of corporate and business structures and workflows.   Module 3 is focused on Organizational Behavior which covers topics such as organizational decision-making, motivation, management, and leadership. The final module, Managing Your Career, pulls the earlier topics together for you to manage your career development and progression. The course is based on a collection of materials (case studies, simulations, articles, and multi-media content) which will be reinforced with class discussion, in-class exercises and activities, and guest lectures.  My goal is to make this a very useful and fun class while challenging the students in areas they have not had to think about before.
